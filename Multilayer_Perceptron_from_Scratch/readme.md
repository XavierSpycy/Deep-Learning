# Description
This project embodies a robust implementation of multilayer perceptron classifiers, entirely built upon the powerful NumPy library. As of now, certain functionalities of our multilayer perceptron have yet to be tested due to the specificity of the task from which the code was initially derived. Nevertheless, we have successfully demonstrated its efficacy in our own unique task. Moving forward, our primary objective is to gradually enhance our model's versatility, ensuring it operates optimally across a diverse array of use cases.     

We provide an exemplary demonstration of how our multilayer perceptron classifiers can be utilized. If you have tasks that align with ours, you can effortlessly tailor our model to your specific needs. On the other hand, if your tasks diverge from ours and our code fails to perform as expected, we encourage you to delve into our multilayer perceptron source code and adjust it to suit your requirements.

# Repository Contents
‘**MLPClassifier.py**’: This Python script houses the implementation of our multilayer perceptron classifier leveraging NumPy.

‘**main.py**’: This Python script provides an exemplary demonstration of our multilayer perceptron classifier in action.

‘**main.ipynb**’: This Jupyter Notebook contains the same content as main.py, but additionally captures the output for interactive exploration and review.

‘**data**’: This directory contains the dataset used for our exemplary demonstration.
